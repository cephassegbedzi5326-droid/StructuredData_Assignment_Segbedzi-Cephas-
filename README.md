# My_Assignments

This dataset contains my personal spending record over one week. Each row represents one transaction, showing the date, spending category, amount, payment method, and a short description

The dataset is organized in a tabular format where:

Each row is a single record (transaction).

Each column represents a specific attribute (Date, Category, Amount, etc.).

All data types are consistent and machine-readable.

Because of this structure, it can easily be analyzed using tools like Excel, Python, or SQL.

I spend most of my money on Food and less on Transport.

Cash is my most frequently used payment method followed by mobile money (Momo)
